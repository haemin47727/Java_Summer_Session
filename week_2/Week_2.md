# Week 2 – Operators, Conditionals, Logic, Loops, Arrays, ArrayLists

---

## Why Learn This?

Control flow and data structures are essential for writing useful programs. This week, you'll learn to:

* Make decisions in code using conditionals.
* Repeat operations with loops.
* Store and manage collections of data using arrays and ArrayLists.
  These tools are used in nearly every program—from calculators to social media platforms.

## Week 2 Concepts & Notes

### Loops

#### for loop

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

#### while loop

```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```

#### do-while loop

```java
int i = 0;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

### Debugger

Discussion on using the debugger.

---

### Arrays

```java
int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30};
System.out.println(numbers[1]);  // 20
```

#### Iterating over arrays

```java
for (int num : numbers) {
    System.out.println(num);
}
```

---

### ArrayLists

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("Apple");
list.add("Banana");
list.remove("Apple");
System.out.println(list.size());  // 1
```

## Quiz Questions

1. **What does the `%` operator do?**
* it returns the remainder of a division operation

2. **What is the result of `while(false)`?**
* this loop will not run - only runs when condition is true

3. **Which loop executes at least once, even if the condition is false?**
* do-while loop will always execute the body of the loop at least once

4. **What’s the default value of an uninitialized `int` array element?**
* zero - the default value of an int primitive is zero

5. **What’s the key difference between an array and an ArrayList?**
* 

6. **What does `break` do inside a loop or switch statement?**
* it will immediately exit the loop or switch and go to the next line of code
outside/below the loop (or switch)

7. **What does `continue` do inside a loop?**
* `continue` will send the flow of execution directly back to the beginning of the loop

## Coding Challenges

1. **Number Comparison**
   Ask the user to enter two numbers. Print which number is greater or if they are equal.

2. **Even or Odd Loop**
   Print whether each number from 1 to 20 is even or odd using a `for` loop.

3. **Sum of Array**
   Create an array of integers and print the total sum.

4. **Favorite Foods List**
   Create an `ArrayList<String>` to store three of your favorite foods. Print them out one per line.

5. **FizzBuzz**
   Print numbers 1 through 30. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz"; for 5, print "Buzz"; for both, print "FizzBuzz".

## Week 2 Summary

* Practiced with loops to create repeating behavior.
* Worked with arrays and ArrayLists to manage collections of data.
* Built practical programs like calculators, graders, and FizzBuzz.
